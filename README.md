Main thing - creating movement system for now

what does it need to do?
1. take in a movement value that the player holds


For the movement of the player, the registering of inputs on the players should be conducted through the cursor. Unfortunately there will be 3 layers to the inputting of this system. 


input system --> cursor --> Checks for player or enemy

the chain of fetching data is kinda poor but oh well
